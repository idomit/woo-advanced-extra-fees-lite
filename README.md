WooCommerce Advanced Extra Fees is the fastest and easiest WooCommerce extra fees plugin with breakthrough performance. Everything works on a fast and easy. Feel no delay – because your time is precious!

WooCommerce has a powerful Fees API that until now was only accessible to developers. With WooCommerce Advanced Fees store owners can setup rules where fees will be added to the Cart based on what is in the cart, who is buying it, or where the products are being shipped to.
With the ‘WooCommerce Advanced Extra Fees Options’ you have the freedom to setup the fee amount based on weight, present shipping classes, categories and products. Each option has its own minimum and maximum fields for quantity / weight / subtotal requirements.

WooCommerce Advanced Extra Fees is a valuable tool for store owners for creating and managing complex fee rules in their store without the help of a developer!
